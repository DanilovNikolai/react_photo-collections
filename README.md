# **Web Application with Collections of Photo**

This is a project where I practiced learning the React library.

# **App description:**

The application consists of only one page and has no routing.
The application allows you to store various photo albums.
There is a sorting by collection type, as well as a search by name.
Pagination is present.
The data is stored on the resource **_https://mockapi.io/._**

1. Using the useState and useEffect hooks;
2. Using rendering of lists with method .map();
3. Using onClick events on elements;
4. Import icons, libraries, hooks and components;
5. Using conditional rendering with the ternary operator;
6. Working with props;

9. Using list sorting and search;
10. Creating adaptations for different screens;
